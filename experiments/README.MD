- The data to reproduce Table 1 are available on [this repository](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1quiURu7w0nU3Pxcc448xRgfeI80okLsS). 
- `data-utils.py` contains starter code to load the 6 datasets in Table 1 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12207).
- You will need to download the files, unzip them and modify the `/home/lemisma/datasets` path in `data-utils.py` to point to your local copy.

We may release additional software to reproduce the experiments, if there is strong user demand.
